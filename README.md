#  Project Overview

<img width="1672" height="941" alt="stylo dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b513da5-1efa-402b-8328-20fa258aee20" />


## Retail Operations Dashboard – Stylo Pakistan (Simulated)

This project is an end-to-end **Retail Operations Dashboard** developed in **Microsoft Power BI** using a simulated dataset inspired by **Stylo Pakistan**, one of Pakistan's leading fashion footwear and lifestyle retailers.

The dashboard replicates a real-world **retail analytics** solution by transforming raw transactional data into an interactive, executive-ready Business Intelligence platform. It enables decision-makers to monitor business performance, evaluate store operations, and analyze product performance through dynamic dashboards, KPIs, and data visualizations.

Designed following industry best practices, the solution incorporates **Star Schema data modeling**, **Power Query ETL**, **DAX calculations**, and interactive reporting to deliver meaningful insights for retail management.

##  Business Objective

Retail organizations generate thousands of transactions every day across multiple stores, products, and customer segments. Without a centralized reporting solution, it becomes difficult to identify performance trends and make timely, data-driven decisions.

This dashboard serves as a **single source of truth**, enabling management to answer key business questions such as:

- Which stores, cities, and provinces are driving or slowing overall revenue?
- How are sales, profit, and profit margins performing over time?
- Which product categories and individual products generate the highest sales and profitability?
- How do different store types perform against each other?
- What is the current return rate, and how does it impact business performance?
- Which sales channels contribute the most revenue?
- How are customer ratings distributed across stores and products?
- Which business areas require management attention to improve operational performance?

By consolidating retail data into a single interactive dashboard, this project helps stakeholders monitor KPIs, identify trends, compare performance across dimensions, and make informed strategic decisions.

- Which product categories drive revenue?
- Which products are most profitable?
- Which provinces perform best?
- How many products are being returned?
- What is the Average Order Value?
- Which sales channel contributes the most revenue?

The objective of this dashboard is to convert raw retail data into actionable business insights.
